# Standalone Bluetooth AI Audio Assistant

This is an early-stage personal technology project exploring a standalone, audio-first AI assistant that works with Bluetooth audio devices without relying on a smartphone.

## Project idea
The goal is to build a dedicated device focused on listening, understanding speech, and providing contextual audio responses with minimal friction and real-world usability in mind.

The project is currently in the prototyping and testing phase.

## Background
I have been using hearing aids for several years, which has given me first-hand experience with the limitations of current audio and assistive technologies in everyday situations.

This project is an experimental, non-commercial exploration and not a medical product.

## Current status
- Development environment set up  
- Early prototype logic under development  
- Audio interaction concepts being tested  

## Funding
Development and prototyping are currently self-funded.

## Notes
This repository is used to document progress and ideas. Code may be experimental and incomplete.
